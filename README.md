Generator
================================

### Quickstart

Checkout [sleeve.phar](https://github.com/CodeSleeve/sleeve.phar) to get started generating.

### How does it work?

This project creates a vanilla generator setup which can be configured for any type of boilerplate generation.

This is really to be used as a third-party library that mediates the workflow for any kind of custom generator templates. If you want to it in action then check out our general purpose Laravel 4 generator [sleeve.phar](https://github.com/CodeSleeve/sleeve.phar). Of course you don't have to use it with Laravel, it could be used to generate code for another framework or language, if that is your cup of tea.

*Here is the main idea.*

> If you combine **variables** + **templates** + **parser** then you have created a generator.
